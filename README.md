# GraphQL API 

### About
This is a simple API that consists of three GraphQL endpoints, which are converted from:
```
ROUTE: GET /users/{username}
RETURNS: {
            username: string # User's username
            email: string    # User's email
            searchedForCount: number # *Amount of /users route invocations
            followerCount: number # Number of followers the user has
            followingCount: number # Number of users the users follow
        }

ROUTE: GET /users/mostSearched?limit=10
PARAMS: limit: number â€“ amount of users to return (required)
RETURNS list of {
            username: string # User's 
            usernameemail: string  # User's email
            searchedForCount: number # *Amount of /users route invocations
            followerCount: number # Number of followers the user has
            followingCount: number # Number of users the users follow
        }

ROUTE: DELETE /searchedForCount
RETURNS: number  
```
Unfortunately, it does not consume GitHub REST API because the creator of this code did not understand the task well. :) It uses 
an array of predefined user objects. Usernames are in the range from 'User1' to 'User15'.
